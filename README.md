## What Tools Does the Template Use?

- Aptos TS SDK
- Node-based Move commands

## Available Move Commands

This tool leverages the [aptos-cli npm package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-cli), allowing us to run Aptos CLI in a Node environment.

Some commands are pre-built into the template and can be run as npm scripts, such as:

- `npm run move:publish` - Command to publish Move contracts
- `npm run move:test` - Command to run Move unit tests
- `npm run move:compile` - Command to compile Move contracts
- `npm run move:upgrade` - Command to upgrade Move contracts

To see all available CLI commands, you can run `npx aptos` and view the list of all available commands.
